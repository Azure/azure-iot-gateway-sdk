# Azure IoT Edge - Simulated device-to-cloud sample

This sample uses Azure IoT Edge to build a simple gateway that uses simulated devices to send telemetry to an Azure IoT hub. The associated [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-linux-iot-edge-simulated-device) provide a detailed walkthrough of the [Simulated Device Cloud Upload sample code](src/main.c) and JSON configuration files to illustrate the fundamental components of the Azure IoT Edge architecture:
