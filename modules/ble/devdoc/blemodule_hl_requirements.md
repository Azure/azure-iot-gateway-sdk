## Overview

This module is a *passthrough* implementation that simply wraps the BLE Module code by providing an easy to use JSON based configuration interface. It de-serializes the JSON into a `BLE_CONFIG` instance and passes control to the underlying implementation.

## BLE_HL_Create
```c
MODULE_HANDLE BLE_HL_Create(BROKER_HANDLE broker, const void* configuration)
```

Creates a new BLE Module HL instance. `configuration` is a `const char*` that contains a JSON string that's typically passed through via the high level Gateway API `Gateway_Create_From_JSON`. The JSON object should conform to the following structure:

```
{
    /**
     * Index of the BLE controller hardware on the device.
     */
    "controller_index": 0,
    
    /**
     * MAC address of the BLE device to connect to.
     */
    "device_mac_address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",
    
    /**
     * One or more instructions to be sent to the BLE device.
     */
    "instructions": [
        {
            /**
             * The instruction type that maps to the `BLEIO_SEQ_INSTRUCTION_TYPE`
             * enumeration from `bleio_seq.h`. The 'type' property can be one of
             * the following: `read_once`, `read_periodic`, `write_at_init` and
             * `write_at_exit` each mapping respectively to the `READ_ONCE`,
             * `READ_PERIODIC`, `WRITE_AT_INIT` and `WRITE_AT_EXIT` values from
             * the `BLEIO_SEQ_INSTRUCTION_TYPE` enumeration.
             */
            "type": "read_once",
            
            /**

            /**
             * For a `read_periodic` instruction this value specifies the
             * sampling frequency for the characteristic in question given
             * in milliseconds.
             */
            "interval_in_ms": 1000
        },
        {

            "characteristic_uuid": "F000AA02-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
            
            /**
             * For `write_at_init` and `write_at_exit` instructions this value
             * provides the data to be written to the device encoded as a Base64
             * string.
             */
            "data": "AQ=="
        },

        }
    ]
